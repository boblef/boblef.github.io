                      Software</a> is a company which has developed a phone-based hearing assistive app, <a
                      href="https://heardthatapp.com/" target="_blank">HeardThat</a> which debuted at CES 2020, that
                    helps people
                    to hear speech in noisy situations by using the power of deep learning. The company was nominated at
                    the top 10 out of about 200 in the <a href="https://www.newventuresbc.com/" target="_blank">New
                      Ventures BC

                      Challenge</a>.</p>
                  I worked as a machine learning developer intern and involved in creating HeardThat app in the
                  early
                  developing stage.

                  <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                  <p>Joined the team in the early development phase, and took initiative on the role of creating several
                    platforms with <span class="marker">Flask</span> and Javascript for
                    <span class="marker">model evaluation</span>, <span class="marker">constructing database with
                      SQLite</span> where results of the evaluation were kept,
                    <span class="amrker">implementing, and training machine
                      learning models</span>. </p>
                  <p>- One of the things I developed for the purpose of the evaluation was an internal visualization
                    tool with Flask where team members can check the spectrogram and waveform of any audio files
                    interactively. Below gif is what I have found on twitter and is pretty similar to what I developed
                    except for one feature that the tool I developed was also able to do arithmetic calculation between
                    audio files and to plot its spectrogram and waveform.</p><br>

                  <p>- Another thing I developed was an external platform which was for <span class="marker">Mechanical
                      Turk</span> where we could
                    collect scores and transcription from people so that we were then able to calculate metrics such as
                    <span class="marker">Mean Opinion Score (MOS)</span> and <span class="marker">Word Error Rate
                      (WER)</span> that were part of metrics that we used to
                    evaluate deep learning models.</p>

                  <p>Worked with team members in an <span class="marker">agile</span> way by changing things as we
                    needed and learned how <span class="marker">Scrum</span> works. Since the internship was
                    remote, gained necessary skills such as <span class="marker">SSH</span> on <span
                      class="marker">Ubuntu</span>, <span class="marker">good communication skills</span> with both
                    verbal
                    and written English with
                    concise explanations, and <span class="marker">writing easy to understand documentation</span>.</p>

              <h5>About this project</h5>

              A <span class="marker">Flask application</span> where we can enter hashtags and keywords related to tweets
              we want to stream and in
              which an NLP model, <span class="marker">FinBERT</span> which is a pre-trained NLP model to analyze the
              <span class="marker">sentiment of the financial
                text</span>, does sentiment analysis on the tweets in real-time. We can see the results of the tweets
              collected containing the hashtags or keywords and their sentiment scores given by FinBERT via <span
                class="marker">Pandas
                dataFrame</span>.
              <br><br>
              <h5>FINBERT</h5>
              It is built by further training the <span class="marker">BERT language model</span> in the finance domain,
              using a large financial
              corpus, Financial Phrase Bank from <a
                href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251231107_Good_Debt_or_Bad_Debt_Detecting_Semantic_Orientations_in_Economic_Texts">Malo
                et al. (2014)</a> which can be downloaded from <a
                href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pekka_Malo/publication/251231364_FinancialPhraseBank-v10/data/0c96051eee4fb1d56e000000/FinancialPhraseBank-v10.zip?origin=publication_list">here
              </a>, and thereby fine-tuning it for financial sentiment classification. For the details, please see
              <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.10063.pdf">FinBERT: Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre-trained
                Language Models</a>.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>Application outline</h5>
              <p class="mb-0 mt-0 font-italic" align="center">
                <img src="img/twitter_sentiment/twitter_sentimental.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" ,
                  width="800" , height="600">
              </p>
              <br>
              It starts by entering hashtags and keywords we want to stream on such as $TSLA, $GOOGL, #CAD, #USDJPY, and
              so on.<br> Since we use the <span class="marker">FinBERT NLP model</span> to get sentiment scores so the
              hashtags and keywords should
              be something that may related to finance.<br>
              The below image is taken after some keywords are given. Now, ready to start streaming by using <span
                class="marker"><a href="http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/">Tweepy</a></span>, which is an API to deal
              with twitter functionality in
              Python.<br><br>
              <p class="mb-0 mt-0 font-italic" align="center">
                <img src="img/twitter_sentiment/twitter_sentiment_top.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" ,
                  width="800" , height="600">
              </p>
              <br>
              After streaming started, each tweet collected including at least one keyword we defined is preprocessed
              with <span class="marker">NLTK</span> to be given a sentiment score by FinBERT</span>.
              Once sentiment score is calculated we store information of each tweet into a csv file and display them in
              a Pandas DataFrame, which we can see the below as an example.<br><br>
              <p class="mb-0 mt-0 font-italic" align="center">
                <img src="img/twitter_sentiment/twitter_sentiment_result.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image" ,
                  width="800" , height="600">
              </p>
              <br>
              <br>
              Yes, we can obviously use something like DynamoDB on AWS by using boto3 library to comminucate with in
              order to store the data instead of a csv file locally.
              <br>
              <br>
              <h5>Further work</h5>
              <ul>
                <li>Some of the functionality used in this application can also be used in the Automated Forex Trading
                  Strategy which I have been working on in order to create new features.
                </li>
                <li>
                  We change the Deep Learning model which gives sentiment scores to tweets to another NLP model which
                  trained on different dataset, if we want to switch the domain we want to use for.
                </li>

              <h5>About the Sudoku solver</h5>

              This is a <span class="marker">Flask</span> app in which it detects Sudoku puzzles that we show to the
              webcam by using <span class="marker">OpenCV</span> and a
              <span class="marker">CNN</span> model which is for recognizing each digit.<br> Once it detected a puzzle,
              then we formulate a
              <span class="marker">Quadratic
                Binary Model (QBM)</span> and an objective function that we want to minimize in order to find the
              solution by
              using D-Wave's quantum computers.<br>
              <br>
              The purpose of this project:
              <ul>
                <li>Learn <span class="marker">the annealing way quantum computers</span> which are good at solving
                  particular problems such as
                  optimization problems.</li>
                <li>Get hands dirty with <span class="marker">OpenCV</span>.</li>

                <li>Though we use the D-Wave quantum computers to solve Sudoku puzzles which has a fascinating speed for
                  the computation, many people access the computers so that we have to wait for a queue for using them.
                  So
                  the total process will take time but usually, it is done within a minute.</li>
                <li>Sometimes the quantum computers can not find the solution for the given Sudoku puzzle especially for
                  difficult ones since quantum computers run the calculation several times and pick up the best solution
                  they found. In other words, it did not converge to an optimum of the objective function.</li>

              In this paper, what they tried was that tried to optimize SureFireStrategy which is a variant of the
              Martingale by using ConvNet as the agent in reinforcement learning in order to find patters in heatmap
              images encoded from time series data by Gramian Angular Field (GAF) which I will talk about later.<br><br>

                First, as illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 2</span>, we purchase one unit at any
                price and set a stop-gain price of +k and a stop-loss price of
                −2k. At the same time, we select a price with a difference
                of −k to the buy price and +k to the stop-loss price and
                set a backhand limit order for three units.
                Backhand refers to engaging in the opposite behavior. The backhand of buying
                is selling and the backhand of selling is buying. A limit order
                refers to the automatic acquisition of corresponding units.<br>
                As illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 3</span>, when a limit order is triggered,
                and three units are successfully sold backhand, we place an
                additional backhand limit order, where the buy price is +k to
                the sell price and −k to the stop-loss price. We set the stopgain point as the difference of
                +k
                and the stop-loss point as
                the difference of −2k, after which an additional six units are
                bought.<br>
                As illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 4</span>, the limit order is triggered in
                the third transaction. The final price exceeded the stop-gain
                price of the first transaction, the stop-loss price of the second
                transaction, and the stop-gain price of the third transaction. In
                this instance, the transaction is complete. The calculation in
                the right block shows that the profit is +1k.

              <h5>3. Data</h5>
              How I got forex data was that I used a <a
                href="https://oanda-api-v20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">python API</a> provided by OANDA
              which is a broker that I use. I was able to gather data in any major timeframe I wanted.<br><br>
              <h5>4. Result</h5>
              The below image is a result plot of training.
              From this plot what I could say were:
              <ul>
                <li>Obviously, the model had not been trained well</li>
                <li>Exploration and exploitation problem</li>
                <li>SureFireStrategy might not fit</li>
                <li>Data quality might be not good enough</li>
              </ul>
              <span class="marker">How I fixed those problems is mentioned in the version 2.0 section.</span>

              <h5>5. Deployment</h5>
              Though I had not got any model that might be able to make a profit on the real market, I deployed the
              model on AWS EC2 and made all the process needed automated by defining operations in a bash script. I also
              set up CloudWatch to turn on and off the server not to waste money on weekends when the forex market
              close.
              <hr>
              <h4>Version 2.0</h4>
              I have been working on the version 2.0 and its differences from the MVP are,
              <ol>
                <li>Trading strategy</li>
                <li>Definition of the state</li>
                <li>Data</li>
                <li>Result</li>
                <li>Further work</li>
              </ol>
              <h5>1. Trading strategy</h5>
              I can see the strength of the SureFire Strategy only when I can bet double continuously over and over
              again. Due to my bankroll size, I was not able to place order like that. So I set a certain pip size to
              exit the market instead of using the SureFireStrategy.<br><br>
              <h5>2. Definition of the state</h5>
              In MVP, I used encoded heatmap images as a state but this might cause the result that the model had not
              been trained well, meaning that ConvNet could not find any patters in the images. So I switched the way to
              define the state to use technical indicators as features that describe the state.<br><br>
              <h5>3. Data</h5>
              In MVP, I used data that OANDA provides, but the data actually had a considerable amount of nans that I
              filled up. And the paper I followed did training on data that had timeframe instead of using bid-ask price
              so that I could not perfectly reproduce the actual price movement that is happening in the real market. So
              I started collecting bid-ask data in real-time that is used to train models in version 2.0.

              </h3>
              <p class="card-text">This is the final team project in Machine Learning Bootcamp at 7 Gate Academy and
                is <span class="marker">an application predicting the likelihood of getting a parking ticket</span> in
                the Vancouver area based on
                the user's geolocation and the time. When a user taps a location at where he is planning to park his
                car or at where he is currently parking his car, that is going to be a trigger to call <span
                  class="marker">AWS Lambda</span>
                where our machine learning model runs to predict the likelihood.<br><br>

                Here is how I and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parampaulnahal/">Paul</a> had <span
                  class="marker">created</span> this application <span class="marker">within a month</span>.
                <img src="img/app_development_ticket_dodger.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
                We found dataset on <a href="https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm"
                  target="_blank">Vancouver open data catalog</a>, the original dataset had the information of parking
                tickets issued such as date time, address including block, infraction, status, etc.
                However the dataset obviously <span class="marker">did not have any target variable that we could
                  use</span> in our case the likelihood or probability
                of getting a parking ticket. I will <span class="marker">explain how we solve this problem in
                  Obstacles section</span>
                below but the <span class="marker">simple answer is that we created by using traffic counts</span> on
                each
                street.<br>
                We <span class="marker">estimated the probability</span> for each street and thresholded them to
                create three categories, <span class="marker">Low</span>,
                <span class="marker">Medium</span>, and <span class="marker">High</span> that were the likelihood we
                were predicting.
                So we <span class="marker">dealt with this problem as a classification problem</span> because it was
                more user-friendly than
                giving users a probability.
                <br>

              <h5>EDA</h5>
              While we were working on feature engineering we found that <span class="marker">the time was
                definetely a factor</span>.
              As you can see below, there is high chances for getting a ticket around 3 PM.<br>

              </div>
              <h5>Training Machine Learning Models</h5>
              As I mentioned, this was a classification problem so we started from training a <span
                class="marker">simple logistic
                regresssion</span> because it was easy to implement.<br>
              Afterwords, we trained different kind of models such as <span class="marker">Random Forest</span>,
              <span class="marker">XGBoost</span>, and <span class="marker">Neural Networks</span>.
              At first we made sure that there was a capacity for models to learn something from our data by trying
              them to <span class="marker">overfit</span> on the training data.<br>
              Then we started <span class="marker">iteratively building more complecated models</span> by changing,
              for instance in <span class="marker">Multi Layer
                Perceptron (MLP)</span>, changing the number of
              neurons in each layer, the number of layers, optimizers, and so on.<br>
              Here is one of the results we got from MLP and XGBoost after <span class="marker">Hyperparameter
                search</span> by using <a href="https://github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas" target="_blank">Hyperas</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/pfnet/optuna">Optuna</a> that are framework in Python for Hyper
              parameter search.

              </div>
              <h5>Model Evaluation</h5>
              <span class="marker">Subjectively evaluating our models was difficult</span>. The best that we could
              say was that we did a pretty
              <span class="marker">good job of determining the low risk</span> of getting a ticket. It is much more
              <span class="marker">important for us to have accurate LOW risks</span>.
              For example, if you park expecting a low risk and you end up getting a ticket, it will be a much worse
              <span class="marker">user experience</span> than if you went in expecting a ticket and got none!
              <br><br>
              We did chase down a parking ticket enforcer and asked for his opinion and he gave us some streets that
              are common of getting a parking ticket. Our predictions from XGBoost were pretty good.
              <span class="marker">Due to model's performance and inference time, 28.19 [ms], we choose XGBoost
                model</span>.<br><br>

              </ul>

              <h5>How did we work as a team</h5><br>
              Since we lived a little bit far to work together in person, it was <span class="marker">important that
                we had a good system
                to work together</span>.<br>
              We started by working together by sourcing our data, evaluating what we have and creating a merged
              base dataset.<br>
              In order to streamline our approach, we then <span class="marker">split up our roles to focus on
                primary areas</span>, building
              machine learning models was my focus and Paul was working on development.<br>
              Afterwards, we <span class="marker">did a knowledge transfer</span> to fill each other on the gaps
              that we might have missed out
              on.<br><br>

              We did loosely<span class="marker"> work in the agile way</span>, changing things as we needed.
              We made sure we reviewed each others work to the standards that we set out for ourselves.
              To do so we used <span class="marker">Trello to manage our tasks</span>. Here are the some of the tags
              we had in our channel on
              Trello.<br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Product backlog</li>
                <li>Current sprint</li>
                <li>Doing</li>
                <li>Review</li>
                <li>Blocked</li>
                <li>Done</li>
              </ul>
              We also had a daily meeting to catch up what everyone had done.<br><br>
              <h5>Obstacles</h5>
              Target variable creation
              As I mentioned above, we did not have a target variable, the probability or the likelihood of getting
              a parking ticket.
              We <span class="marker">created one by using three datasets</span>, one that contained the information
              of parking tickets issued,
              second that had the traffic counts on each street including some private streets, and third that had
              almost all of the street name in the Vancouver area.<br>
              It was <span class="marker">important for us to define what we mean by “Risk".</span><br>
              It was a fairly arbitrary term.
              We had decided to use the number of tickets given, divided by the amount of traffic on the street.
              In this way, <span class="marker">we defined risk RELATIVE to the risk of other streets</span>.
              The formula for estimating the probability for each block on each street was as follows:<br><br>
              <div class="text-center container">
                <div class="col-xs-6">
                  <!-- Create latex here: https://www.codecogs.com/latex/eqneditor.php -->
                  <img src="img/CodeCogsEqn.gif" class="img-fluid">
                </div>
              </div>
              <br>

              In order to do the calculation, we needed to make sure that <span class="marker">each street</span> in
              the parking ticket dataset
              and traffic counts dataset were <span class="marker">the same format</span> to marge the two datasets
              with the streets as the key.<br>
              Here is an example of a street we needed to clean up: <span class="marker">"WEST GEORGIA"</span> and
              <span class="marker">"GEORGIA W"</span><br>
              So we used a Python framework, <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy"
                target="_blank">fuzzywazzy</a>, to clean up the streets name.
