                      Software</a> has created a phone-based app, <a href="https://heardthatapp.com/"

                    I worked as a machine learning developer intern and involved in creating HeardThat app in the
                    early
                    developing stage.

                  <h5>Responsibilities</h5>
                  <p>When I joined the team, the first thing I did was that tried to catch up what they were trying to
                    do and how to solve the problem and to understand the key part of the workflow such as preprocessing
                    step, what comes into the models, and what comes out from the models. After gained solid
                    understandings, I trained machine learning models and did evaluations of models that team members
                    trained. </p>
                  <p>- One of the things I developed for the purpose of the evaluation was an internal visualization
                    tool with Flask where team members can check the spectrogram and waveform of any audio files
                    interactively. Below gif is what I have found on twitter and is pretty similar to what I developed
                    except for one feature that the tool I developed was also able to do arithmetic calculation between
                    audio files and to plot its spectrogram and waveform.</p><br>

                  <br>

                  <p>- Another thing I developed was an external platform which was for Mechanical Turk where we could
                    collect scores and transcription from people so that we were then able to calculate metrics such as
                    Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Word Error Rate (WER) that were part of metrics that we used to
                    evaluate deep learning models.</p>

                  <p>This internship was a remote work so we had a daily meeting on the call every day to catch up on
                    what everyone had done so far and what things each member was working on. From this experience, I
                    gained explanation skills that are concise and well structured.</p>

              <p><span class="marker">This is an automated forex trading strategy by using the power of reinforcement
                  learning which is a
                  type of machine learning. The goal is to optimize a forex trading strategy and to make a profit with
                  it
                  on the real financial market while I am sleeping.</span> </p>

              About this project can be separated into two sections, MVP and version 2.0.<br>
              <ul>
                <li><span class="marker">In MVP section</span>: </li>I will introduce you what I had done and the result
                I got from the first deep reinforcement learning model.
                <li><span class="marker">In version 2.0 section</span>: </li>I will mention what I changed, especially
                preprocessing in order to make a better model and will show you improved results.
              </ul>
              <hr>

              <h4>MVP</h4>
              First, I will list up key parts in MVP that I finished almost within a month and then I will add
              explanation to each of them.<br>

              In this paper, what they tried was that tried to optimize SureFireStrategy which is a variant of the
              Martingale by using ConvNet as the agent in reinforcement learning in order to find patters in heatmap
              images encoded from time series data by Gramian Angular Field (GAF) which I will talk about later.<br><br>

                First, as illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 2</span>, we purchase one unit at any
                price and set a stop-gain price of +k and a stop-loss price of
                −2k. At the same time, we select a price with a difference
                of −k to the buy price and +k to the stop-loss price and
                set a backhand limit order for three units.
                Backhand refers to engaging in the opposite behavior. The backhand of buying
                is selling and the backhand of selling is buying. A limit order
                refers to the automatic acquisition of corresponding units.<br>
                As illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 3</span>, when a limit order is triggered,
                and three units are successfully sold backhand, we place an
                additional backhand limit order, where the buy price is +k to
                the sell price and −k to the stop-loss price. We set the stopgain point as the difference of
                +k
                and the stop-loss point as
                the difference of −2k, after which an additional six units are
                bought.<br>
                As illustrated in <span class="marker">Fig. 4</span>, the limit order is triggered in
                the third transaction. The final price exceeded the stop-gain
                price of the first transaction, the stop-loss price of the second
                transaction, and the stop-gain price of the third transaction. In
                this instance, the transaction is complete. The calculation in
                the right block shows that the profit is +1k.

              <h5>3. Data</h5>
              How I got forex data was that I used a <a
                href="https://oanda-api-v20.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html">python API</a> provided by OANDA
              which is a broker that I use. I was able to gather data in any major timeframe I wanted.<br><br>
              <h5>4. Result</h5>
              The below image is a result plot of training.
              From this plot what I could say were:
              <ul>
                <li>Obviously, the model had not been trained well</li>
                <li>Exploration and exploitation problem</li>
                <li>SureFireStrategy might not fit</li>
                <li>Data quality might be not good enough</li>
              </ul>
              <span class="marker">How I fixed those problems is mentioned in the version 2.0 section.</span>

              <h5>5. Deployment</h5>
              Though I had not got any model that might be able to make a profit on the real market, I deployed the
              model on AWS EC2 and made all the process needed automated by defining operations in a bash script. I also
              set up CloudWatch to turn on and off the server not to waste money on weekends when the forex market
              close.
              <hr>
              <h4>Version 2.0</h4>
              I have been working on the version 2.0 and its differences from the MVP are,
              <ol>
                <li>Trading strategy</li>
                <li>Definition of the state</li>
                <li>Data</li>
                <li>Result</li>
                <li>Further work</li>
              </ol>
              <h5>1. Trading strategy</h5>
              I can see the strength of the SureFire Strategy only when I can bet double continuously over and over
              again. Due to my bankroll size, I was not able to place order like that. So I set a certain pip size to
              exit the market instead of using the SureFireStrategy.<br><br>
              <h5>2. Definition of the state</h5>
              In MVP, I used encoded heatmap images as a state but this might cause the result that the model had not
              been trained well, meaning that ConvNet could not find any patters in the images. So I switched the way to
              define the state to use technical indicators as features that describe the state.<br><br>
              <h5>3. Data</h5>
              In MVP, I used data that OANDA provides, but the data actually had a considerable amount of nans that I
              filled up. And the paper I followed did training on data that had timeframe instead of using bid-ask price
              so that I could not perfectly reproduce the actual price movement that is happening in the real market. So
              I started collecting bid-ask data in real-time that is used to train models in version 2.0.

              <p class="card-text">This is the final team project in Machine Learning Bootcamp at 7 Gate Academy and
                is <span class="marker">an application predicting the likelihood of getting a parking ticket</span> in
                the Vancouver area based on
                the user's geolocation and the time. When a user taps a location at where he is planning to park his
                car or at where he is currently parking his car, that is going to be a trigger to call <span
                  class="marker">AWS Lambda</span>
                where our machine learning model runs to predict the likelihood.<br><br>

                Here is how I and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/parampaulnahal/">Paul</a> had <span
                  class="marker">created</span> this application <span class="marker">within a month</span>.
                <img src="img/app_development_ticket_dodger.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image"><br>
                We found dataset on <a href="https://data.vancouver.ca/datacatalogue/index.htm"
                  target="_blank">Vancouver open data catalog</a>, the original dataset had the information of parking
                tickets issued such as date time, address including block, infraction, status, etc.
                However the dataset obviously <span class="marker">did not have any target variable that we could
                  use</span> in our case the likelihood or probability
                of getting a parking ticket. I will <span class="marker">explain how we solve this problem in
                  Obstacles section</span>
                below but the <span class="marker">simple answer is that we created by using traffic counts</span> on
                each
                street.<br>
                We <span class="marker">estimated the probability</span> for each street and thresholded them to
                create three categories, <span class="marker">Low</span>,
                <span class="marker">Medium</span>, and <span class="marker">High</span> that were the likelihood we
                were predicting.
                So we <span class="marker">dealt with this problem as a classification problem</span> because it was
                more user-friendly than
                giving users a probability.
                <br>

              <h5>EDA</h5>
              While we were working on feature engineering we found that <span class="marker">the time was
                definetely a factor</span>.
              As you can see below, there is high chances for getting a ticket around 3 PM.<br>

              </div>
              <h5>Training Machine Learning Models</h5>
              As I mentioned, this was a classification problem so we started from training a <span
                class="marker">simple logistic
                regresssion</span> because it was easy to implement.<br>
              Afterwords, we trained different kind of models such as <span class="marker">Random Forest</span>,
              <span class="marker">XGBoost</span>, and <span class="marker">Neural Networks</span>.
              At first we made sure that there was a capacity for models to learn something from our data by trying
              them to <span class="marker">overfit</span> on the training data.<br>
              Then we started <span class="marker">iteratively building more complecated models</span> by changing,
              for instance in <span class="marker">Multi Layer
                Perceptron (MLP)</span>, changing the number of
              neurons in each layer, the number of layers, optimizers, and so on.<br>
              Here is one of the results we got from MLP and XGBoost after <span class="marker">Hyperparameter
                search</span> by using <a href="https://github.com/maxpumperla/hyperas" target="_blank">Hyperas</a>
              and <a href="https://github.com/pfnet/optuna">Optuna</a> that are framework in Python for Hyper
              parameter search.

              <h5>Model Evaluation</h5>
              <span class="marker">Subjectively evaluating our models was difficult</span>. The best that we could
              say was that we did a pretty
              <span class="marker">good job of determining the low risk</span> of getting a ticket. It is much more
              <span class="marker">important for us to have accurate LOW risks</span>.
              For example, if you park expecting a low risk and you end up getting a ticket, it will be a much worse
              <span class="marker">user experience</span> than if you went in expecting a ticket and got none!
              <br><br>
              We did chase down a parking ticket enforcer and asked for his opinion and he gave us some streets that
              are common of getting a parking ticket. Our predictions from XGBoost were pretty good.
              <span class="marker">Due to model's performance and inference time, 28.19 [ms], we choose XGBoost
                model</span>.<br><br>

              <h5>How did we work as a team</h5><br>
              Since we lived a little bit far to work together in person, it was <span class="marker">important that
                we had a good system
                to work together</span>.<br>
              We started by working together by sourcing our data, evaluating what we have and creating a merged
              base dataset.<br>
              In order to streamline our approach, we then <span class="marker">split up our roles to focus on
                primary areas</span>, building
              machine learning models was my focus and Paul was working on development.<br>
              Afterwards, we <span class="marker">did a knowledge transfer</span> to fill each other on the gaps
              that we might have missed out
              on.<br><br>

              We did loosely<span class="marker"> work in the agile way</span>, changing things as we needed.
              We made sure we reviewed each others work to the standards that we set out for ourselves.
              To do so we used <span class="marker">Trello to manage our tasks</span>. Here are the some of the tags
              we had in our channel on
              Trello.<br><br>
              <ul>
                <li>Product backlog</li>
                <li>Current sprint</li>
                <li>Doing</li>
                <li>Review</li>
                <li>Blocked</li>
                <li>Done</li>
              </ul>
              We also had a daily meeting to catch up what everyone had done.<br><br>
              <h5>Obstacles</h5>
              Target variable creation
              As I mentioned above, we did not have a target variable, the probability or the likelihood of getting
              a parking ticket.
              We <span class="marker">created one by using three datasets</span>, one that contained the information
              of parking tickets issued,
              second that had the traffic counts on each street including some private streets, and third that had
              almost all of the street name in the Vancouver area.<br>
              It was <span class="marker">important for us to define what we mean by “Risk".</span><br>
              It was a fairly arbitrary term.
              We had decided to use the number of tickets given, divided by the amount of traffic on the street.
              In this way, <span class="marker">we defined risk RELATIVE to the risk of other streets</span>.
              The formula for estimating the probability for each block on each street was as follows:<br><br>
              <div class="text-center container">
                <div class="row">
                  <div class="col-xs-6">
                    <img src="img/CodeCogsEqn.gif" class="img-fluid">
                  </div>
                </div>
              </div><br>

              In order to do the calculation, we needed to make sure that <span class="marker">each street</span> in
              the parking ticket dataset
              and traffic counts dataset were <span class="marker">the same format</span> to marge the two datasets
              with the streets as the key.<br>
              Here is an example of a street we needed to clean up: <span class="marker">"WEST GEORGIA"</span> and
              <span class="marker">"GEORGIA W"</span><br>
              So we used a Python framework, <a href="https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy"
                target="_blank">fuzzywazzy</a>, to clean up the streets name.
